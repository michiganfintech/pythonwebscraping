# pythonwebscraping
In this workshop, we will be learning how to use Python and LXML to scrape stock market data from publicly available websites. This is a great way to combine a commonly used technique in computer science and data science while also learning about some key metrics in finance.   We will also be using financial APIs to compare current data with historical data and adding other features such as email integration!
